    st.write("ANOVA, which stands for Analysis of Variance, is a nifty method to compare three or more groups and see if they're actually different from each other. In my QC lab, we're always looking to try out new processes, especially the automated kind. So, we'd want to check out how the results from the old manual process stack up against the new automatic one. Of course, the new method has to be just as good as the old one, right? That's when ANOVA swoops in to save the day â€“ it helps you make sure you're picking the best option.")
